## How regular expressions works in JavaScript(regex)

### What are Regular Expressions or regex in JavaScript?

**Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.**

### What do Regular Expressions allow you to do?

**Regular expressions are used with the regex methods test() and exec() and it allow you to do  match() , replace() , search() , and split() 
.** 

### Syntax of regex in JS

```
/pattern/flags
```


### Flags in Regular Expressions 

A regular expression in JS consists of 6 flags: i, g, m, u, s, y. Without flags, the search by a regex is the same as a substring search. 


- i:- Ignore Casing mode ( the search is case-insensitive: no difference between A and a )

- g:- global mode (Makes the expression search for all occurrences)

- m:- Multiline mode (Makes the boundary characters ^ and $ match the beginning and end of every single line instead of the beginning and end of the whole string.)

- s:- Dot All mode (Makes a wild character . matches newlines as well.)

- u:- Unicode mode (Makes the expression assume individual characters as code points, not code units, and thus match 32-bit characters as well.)

- y:- Sticky mode (searching at the exact position in the text)


### How to add these flags to a regex?

forward slashes //, flags come after the second slash. 
In general notation we can express this as follows:

```
> /pattern/flags
```

## Letâ€™s look at the example below of Regular Expressions

```
