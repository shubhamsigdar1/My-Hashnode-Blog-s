## Agile Model in Software Development Life Cycle.

### Why does the Agile method come into existence?
****
In Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC), one of the methodologies we use is called** Waterfall Model **

**When we make software we follow some steps:-**

1. Requirement and analysis
2. Design
3. Code
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

In the Waterfall model, If we go from the requirement phase to the design phase and if we want to go back then we will not able to go back. 
**For Example:-**In 6 months, you are done with coding and now you are testing it, and suddenly your client comes to you and says, "Hey team, I want to make some changes in my application, but in the waterfall model, there is the rule that you have to get the entire requirement of your application before starting the project." i.e. you will not able to say I will get some requirements later. So you have to get all the requirements and then only you can start making a client project.

**There are some issues with the waterfall model:**

1. The waterfall model has lacked interaction among phases. 
2. The time to market is low.
3. In the waterfall model, if u want to make changes it's very difficult.

So, there are groups of people who come together and give some philosophy and they named that philosophy which is called ** > Agile.**

### What is the Agile Model or Agile methodology or Agile process in SDLC?

1. It is an iterative or incremental approach, where the requirement keeps on changing, As a company, we should be flexible enough to handle those requirement changes, develop those requirement changes, test those requirement changes and finally give the working peace of the software to the customer within a short span of time i.e. called as an **Agile model**. 

2. Agile model is something that a company should follow or adopt in order to give fast delivery of the software to the customer within a short span of time.

### To build projects, Agile Software Development follows 4 values and 12 principles.
****
### Four values are:-

1. Focus on Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

2. Focus on Working software over comprehensive documentation

3. Focus on Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

4. Responding to change over following a plan i.e. use MVP.

### Twelves principles are:-

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. After making half of the project the client says we want these new features then you should not say NO.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development i.e. The team must find a working pace (40 hours per week or so) that is sustainable and healthy for the long term.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
